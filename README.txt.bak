Okay so I need to use gluestack.ui for the ui

this will be a react native app 

created with expo 

expo / native / apis to install:

react-native-gesture-handler
expo-dev-client
expo-background-fetch
expo-calander
expo-camera
react-native-view-shot (could be useful for signing contracts, directly in app. create a signature box that uses full screen. then remove background after button push, then use captureRef {imported by reactnativeviewshot} and then you can reference the capture on the document.)
expo-checkbox
expo-clipboard
expo-constants (not sure how or why this would be needed, but it gives system info that remains constant throughout the life of the install. device info etc. assuming used to speed up things. or analytics on the backend.)
maybe *{expo-Crypto}
@react-native-community/datetimepicker (could be used to schedule unavailability days and times for contractors.)
expo-device
expo-document-picker (for uploading photos taken outside of the app for any issues.) maybe expo-file-system
react-native-gesture-handler
expo-haptics
expo-image
expo-image-picker
expo-intent-launcher used to adjust settings inside android. for instance popping users straight to location settings, or notification settings. 
expo-keep-awake may be good to use for photouploads? or maybe a quick fix for any issues that you run into with file uploading in the background.
(maybe) expo-linear-gradient I may use tamagui so may not need this for UI 
expo-linking can be used for linking with other installed apps using deep links
expo-local-authentication !!!!!! this is important, its for faceid and the fingerprint scanner. good for quick sign in
expo-location android and ios have different names
expo-mail-composer for admin contacts or for sending emails to me (Developer)
expo-manifest
react-native-maps
expo-media-library
@react-native-community/netinfo
expo-network
expo-notifications (push)
@react-native-picker/picker
"router UI" expo-router
react-native-safe-area-context
expo-secure-store (to be used to store boolean information such as wether or not face ID can be used)
 @react-native-community/slider
 expo-sms
 expo-splash-screen used to tell the splash to stay visible until it has been told to hide. good for loading times and api calls 
 expo-status-bar
 expo-task-manager
 expo-tracking-transparency usadd NSUserTrackingUsageDescription to your info.plist to explain how the user will be tracked. or it will be rejected by apple. 
 expo-updates
 expo-video
 expo-video-thumbnails
 react-native-pager-view

 firebase cloud function example:

        const functions = require('firebase-functions');
        const admin = require('firebase-admin');
        const { google } = require('googleapis');

        admin.initializeApp();

        const drive = google.drive('v3');

        exports.uploadToGoogleDrive = functions.storage.object().onFinalize(async (object) => {
        const bucket = admin.storage().bucket(object.bucket);
        const file = bucket.file(object.name);

        // Authenticate with Google Drive
        const auth = new google.auth.GoogleAuth({
            scopes: ['https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive'], // Note: 'drive' scope for write access
            keyFile: 'path/to/your/service-account-key.json',
        });
        const client = await auth.getClient();

        // Download the photo from Firebase Storage
        const fileData = await file.get();

        // Process the photo (optional)
        // ...

        // Upload the photo to Google Drive
        const driveFileMetadata = {
            name: object.name,
            parents: ['your-google-drive-folder-id'], // Replace with your folder ID
        };
        const uploadResponse = await drive.files.create({
            resource: driveFileMetadata,
            media: {
            mimeType: 'image/jpeg', // Adjust based on your image type
            body: fileData[0], // Photo data
            },
            auth: client,
        });

        // ... (Optional: Delete the photo from Firebase Storage)
        });
